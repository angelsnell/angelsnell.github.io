      <h2>Old Testament Roots</h2>
      <p><strong>Exodus 16:11–15 (NAB):</strong> “The LORD spoke to Moses and said: I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them: In the evening twilight you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall have your fill of bread, so that you may know that I, the LORD, am your God. In the evening quail came up and covered the camp. In the morning a layer of dew lay all about the camp, and when the layer of dew evaporated, fine flakes were on the surface of the wilderness, fine flakes like hoarfrost on the ground. On seeing it, the Israelites asked one another, ‘What is this?’ for they did not know what it was. But Moses told them, ‘It is the bread which the LORD has given you to eat.’”</p>
      <p>This prefigures the Eucharist because God feeds His people with bread from heaven, foreshadowing the true Bread of Life, Jesus Christ (cf. Catechism of the Catholic Church 1334).</p>

      <h2>New Testament Roots</h2>
      <p><strong>Luke 22:14–20 (NAB):</strong> “When the hour came, he took his place at table with the apostles. He said to them, ‘I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer, for, I tell you, I shall not eat it [again] until there is fulfillment in the kingdom of God.’ Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and said, ‘Take this and share it among yourselves; for I tell you [that] from this time on I shall not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.’ Then he took the bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them, saying, ‘This is my body, which will be given for you; do this in memory of me.’ And likewise the cup after they had eaten, saying, ‘This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which will be shed for you.’”</p>
      <p>This is the direct institution of the Eucharist. Jesus commands His apostles to “do this in memory of me” (Luke 22:19), which the Church continues at every Mass.</p>

    <section id="matter">
      <h2>Matter of the Sacrament</h2>
      <p>The matter of the Eucharist is wheat bread and grape wine. As the Catechism teaches: “The essential signs of the Eucharistic sacrament are wheat bread and grape wine, on which the blessing of the Holy Spirit is invoked” (CCC 1412). Their significance is that Christ uses the basic elements of nourishment to give us His Body and Blood.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="form">
      <h2>Form of the Sacrament</h2>
      <p>The form of the Eucharist are the words of consecration spoken by the priest: “This is my body… This is the chalice of my blood…” (cf. CCC 1412). These words bring about the Real Presence of Christ under the appearances of bread and wine.</p>

      <h2>Effects of the Eucharist</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Union with Christ:</strong> “Communion with the body and blood of Christ increases the communicant’s union with the Lord” (CCC 1416).</li>
        <li><strong>Strengthening of charity:</strong> “The Eucharist strengthens our charity, which tends to be weakened in daily life” (CCC 1394).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Responses to Common Objections</h2>
      <h3>Isn’t it just a symbol?</h3>
      <p>The Church teaches that the Eucharist is the true Body and Blood of Christ, not a mere symbol. “In the most blessed sacrament of the Eucharist the body and blood, together with the soul and divinity, of our Lord Jesus Christ is truly, really, and substantially contained” (CCC 1374).</p>
      
      <h3>Aren’t Catholics taking Jesus too literally?</h3>
      <p>In John 6:53 Jesus says, “Amen, amen, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life within you.” The Church has always understood this literally, supported by Christ’s words at the Last Supper (Luke 22:19–20).</p>
      
      <h3>Why can’t non-Catholics receive?</h3>
      <p>Because the Eucharist is a sign of unity in faith, those who are not fully in communion with the Church cannot ordinarily receive it. “Ecclesial communities derived from the Reformation… have not preserved the proper reality of the Eucharistic mystery in its fullness. It is for this reason that Eucharistic intercommunion with these communities is not possible” (CCC 1400).</p>
